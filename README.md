My first standalone HTML/CSS project. Based on inspiration design found on Dribble. 

Layout and project idea was taken from inspiration design on Dribble. (Credit: Arafat - UI/UX)<br/>

Design isn't copied fully, because I didn't have access to UI design files or images/icons from original design.

Timeframe: 5-6 hours
